            <h1>Clean Water & Sanitation Next Steps</h1>
            <p>Although this product has a niche market, it concerns well-being and, frankly, life. Consumers have a compelling reason to purchase if they have encountered water quality issues in their homes or on their travels in the past. However, there are some potential roadblocks.</p>

            <h3>Roadblocks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No current competitors exist, but with the growing number of sustainability focused researchers, some could soon emerge.</li>
                <li>The validation of the research requires rigerous testing and the product could require EPA approval since it deals with water potability.</li>
                <li>The potential for faulty analyses could raise skepticism on the accuracy of the product.</li>
            </ul>

            </br>

            <p>The following short-and-long-term goals attempt to address these roadblocks through well formed plans for rapid development and market release.</p>

            <h3>Short term</h3>
            <p>While the paper (see the solutions tab) positively indicates the UV-Vis method initially tested would work well for a deep learning framework, further validation is needed with more rigerous analysis and testing.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a strong focus is being placed on applying to NSF and environmental sustainability grants.</p>

            <h3>Long term</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Development of the UV-Vis technique into a marketable product.</li>
                <li>Obtain venture capital, partnering with those interested in environmental sustainability.</li>
                <li>Find additional members for the initative. Ideally, two individuals geared towards business and marketing, while I research.</li>
                <li>Research similar deep learning frameworks and architectures for the algorithmic portion of the product.</li>
            </ul>
