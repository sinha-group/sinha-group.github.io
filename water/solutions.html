            <h3>A mobile and low-cost spectrophotometry based water-quality monitoring system using off-the-shelf web-cameras</h3>
            <p>The solution proposed here is a water quality monitoring solution I am working on. My proposal solves major two issues that are present in other commercial solutions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Mobility: current solutions for determining water quality include UV-Vis spectrometers, mass spectrometers, coloremetry tests, and more. However, these tests are not portable or require a laboratory to accurately test.
                </li>

                </br>

                <li>
                    Cost: the cost of laboratory tests can be inhibiting, and laboratory results are not easily interpretable and can take weeks.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This solution could be packaged in two ways: an attachment to domestic faucets for real-time water-quality monitoring, or a portable unit that could be filled with a water sample. It would rely on UV-Vis spectrophotometry techniques used in comination with deep learning models. The viability of this is discussed in the full paper for download below (#8).</p>
            <p>The product could be purchased online or at specialized retailers (outdoor gear centers, sports centers, well-being outlets). The cost per unit would be variable depending on region and the type (faucet attachment or portable unit), but would average in the $100 USD range.</p>
            <p>A viable business model would require funding to rigerously test the product and design the packaging. Equity options could attract large stage investors, while private investments or NSF and environmental sustainability grants could support early term develvopment.</p>
            <p>Development could, conservatively, take an additional two years, requiring up to $300,000 for a three-member team--for research, business, and media outreach--and cost around $19,500 USD to start first supply shipments (based on a 15,000 fixed-cost estimate for mold-injections, and parts for 300 widgets at a variable cost of $15/widget). Totaling to $315,000 USD over the course of 2 years with three members.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there are no major legal challenges and no substitute products known so far.</p>

            <h3>Research reports</h3>
            <p>Below are periodic reports that I wrote throughout my research in 2018-2019.</p>
            <p>The final report, #8, is a full paper I submitted to the 2019 Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference.</p>
