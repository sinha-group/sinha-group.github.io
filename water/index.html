            <h1>Clean Water Initative</h1>
            <p class="black-box">According to the UN, there is sufficient clean, fresh water for all, yet, 3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services.</p>

            <p>In 2015, the United Nations came out with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to achieve by 2030. The 6th of which is clean water and sanitation for all peoples.</p>
            <p>This page focuses on specific developments of the clean water goal in SDG 6.</p>
            
            </br>

            <h3>Current water-quality detection solutions</h3>
            <p>There is sufficient clean water globally. Historically, ccess to this water has been an issue. Now, new issues arise from poor sanitation.</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/">"Each day, nearly 1,000 children die due to preventable water and sanitation-related diarrheal diseases"</blockquote>
            <p>Sanitation and water purity tests can be laboratory tested, but is typically costly. Mobile solutions exist, but they are are non-reusable or only test for very specific contaminants.</p>

            </br>

            <h3>What is this website about?</h3>
            <p>The solutions section of website focuses on my research in designing a water-quality monitoring system that can run a spectrometric procedure on-site or in real-time. It explores testing UV-vis spectrophotometry with deep learning techniques to train light-sensing parameters for lead, arsenic and oil in water. These impurities were chosen because of their threat to global health. An on-site water-quality monitoring system can aid in identifying clean water sources in catastrophe-stricken areas and prevent incidental exposure to contaminants in tap water from transport-pipeline seepage. </p>
